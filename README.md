## Business Activities

* What specific problem is the company or project trying to solve?
    - The main problem is the amount of time and resources traditionally go into researching the potential and viability of new product ideas in a given market. Each market has its taste and marketing preferences highly influenced by culture, so breaking into new markets can be very difficult and time-conduming if you have little experience in a given market.
    
    - Using AI has allowed Ai Palette how to track quick-changing trends in consumer products preferences, as well as taste preferences across various markets
       >“For example, a company wants to launch a new juice in a market like Thailand, our platform will tell them what kind of juice they should launch, along with how they should position it, so that it is successful in the market,” from a CNBC Interview
